## Hi, I'm Pinzhi Huang 👋

I also go by **Edwin Huang**.  
I'm an undergraduate at NYU advised by [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/).  
Previously, I interned at @Google Gemini

I spend my time training LLMs and brewing the perfect espresso — which, surprisingly, require very similar skills. ☕️
