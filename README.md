## Hi, I'm Edwin 👋

I also go by the name [Pinzhi Huang](https://pinzhihuang.github.io/).  
I'm an undergraduate at NYU advised by [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/).  
Previously, I interned at @Google Gemini.

I spend my time training LLMs and making espresso. I enjoy experimenting to find the right recipe. ☕️
